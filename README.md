# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
It is a prediction model which predicts emotions reflected through speech. It captures audio using the microphone and converts it to text using 
speech recognition, and then uses a BERT-based sentiment analysis model to predict the emotions associated with the recognized text.

Techstack used in this project: Python libraries- transformers, TensorFlow, speech_recognition

Instruction for installation:
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset - A predefined dataset is used in this project which is taken from 'The Hugging man face'.

Since it is a prediction model so it will give the probability of different emotions expressed through a human voice.
Output of this project looks like -

In future, I am going to create a web based application an add on some amzing and creative features to it.
